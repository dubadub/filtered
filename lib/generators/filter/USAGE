Description:
    Stubs out a new filter. Pass the filter name, either CamelCased or
    under_scored, and an optional list of fields as arguments.

    You don't have to think up every field up front, but it helps to
    sketch out a few so you can start working with the filter immediately.

    To create a filter within a module, specify the filter name as a
    path like 'parent_module/filter_name'.

Example:
    `rails generate filter users group persmission`

    Users filter.
        Filter:     app/filters/users_filter.rb
